# Addendum to README.md

The original README.md file was inherited from the forked project. It remains unaltered, other than a reference to this file. 

This addendum describes additional files created during the course of the assigment. While the final submission will be a process contained in a single file, other files (including this one) were created as part of the exploration.

"first-pass.Rmd" may be thought of as a rough draft, mostly of the text, but with the appropriate code interspersed. Accompanying it is "first-pass-worspace.R" which is an R script serving as the workspace in which we developed the code. It serves as a record of the process, since much of its contents will be cut from the final submission.

"first-pass.Rmd" is then compiled to DOC, so that spelling and grammar can be checked using a desktop wordprocessor. It is copied onto "PA1_template.Rmd" where the spelling and grammar are corrected, immediately before submission.
